                <h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why Chaturbate gives out 200 tokens</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fraudulent tokens cost Chaturbate money. When someone pays with stolen money it hurts Chaturbate. To prevent losses Chaturbate puts a tight limit on your spending until you prove to Chaturbate you are an authorized person to spend these money. Filling forms doesn't sound fun. To motivate you to fill the form Chaturbate rewards you 200 tokens. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How do I know that is legit? </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Don't trust me. Trust Chaturbate. Visit the page where Chaturbate tells about the deal: </span><a target="_blank" href="https://chaturbate.com/tipping/free_tokens/?campaign=PNK3s" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How can I receive tokens free</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I want those 200 tokens. How do I get them?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You'll do this in 3 steps, it'll take five to ten minutes. You'll need a pen, your ID, a printer and a phone with a camera or a scanner.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">🖨️ Step 1 — download and print the form</span></h3>

<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">🖊️Step 2 — fill the form</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Read the form and fill it. What goes where:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Customer name — your full legal name. </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Billing address — your full billing address for the payment method. </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Email — your email Chaturbate staff can use to contact you.</span></li>

<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wait for Chaturbate Support to confirm your request. Can take up to 48 hours but often happens faster.</span></li>
</ol>
